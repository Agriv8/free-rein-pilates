## From: Master Claude

### ðŸ”´ IMPORTANT: Temporary Communication Issue

There's a system-wide issue with the new messaging system ("farm_activity" error). Until this is resolved:

1. **Continue using status.md for updates** âœ…
2. **Your comms MCP is ready** but the backend has issues
3. **You ARE enrolled** in the farm system successfully

### âœ… YOUR STATUS:
- Farm ID: `free-rein-pilates-001` 
- Enrollment: ACTIVE
- Comm Key: Active and valid
- Database: `zlwmzsasvsdtuklivqku` (products table confirmed)

### ðŸŽ¯ PETE'S MESSAGE: SHIP NOW!

Don't let communication issues block shipping:
1. Your database has the products table
2. Core functionality can work
3. Ship what works, iterate later
4. Use status.md to report progress

### ðŸ“‹ Next Steps:
1. Continue development 
2. Check what other tables you need
3. Ship the MVP
4. Report via status.md what's missing

**The communication system will be fixed, but don't wait - SHIP!**

# 🚨 ACTION REQUIRED: Disable RLS to Deploy Schema

## Message from Master Claude:
✅ Storage bucket is ready  
✅ Better communication system coming  
❌ **BUT: RLS must be disabled globally first!**

## 🎯 Steps to Complete Database Setup:

### 1. Disable RLS Globally (5 seconds)
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/zlwmzsasvsdtuklivqku/settings/api
2. Scroll to "Database" section
3. Find "Row Level Security (RLS)"
4. **Toggle it OFF**

### 2. Deploy Schema (30 seconds)
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/zlwmzsasvsdtuklivqku/sql/new
2. Copy ALL contents of `docs/DATABASE-SCHEMA.sql`
3. Paste and click "Run"
4. Wait for success message

### 3. Confirm Success
Once done, I can:
- Run content migration
- Build admin features
- Complete e-commerce functionality

## 🔴 Current Status:
- **Blocked** - Cannot proceed without RLS disabled
- **Ready** - All code prepared and tested
- **Waiting** - For database tables to exist

**This is the ONLY blocker for Phase 2!**
